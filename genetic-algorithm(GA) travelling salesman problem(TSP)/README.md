# genetic algorithm
A genetic algorithm is a search heuristic that is inspired by Charles Darwinâ€™s theory of natural evolution. This algorithm reflects the process of natural selection where the fittest individuals are selected for reproduction in order to produce offspring of the next generation.

    START
    Generate the initial population
    Compute fitness 
    REPEAT
        Selection
        Crossover
        Mutation
        Compute fitness
    UNTIL population has converged
    STOP

# problem:
For this assignment, we need to implement the Genetic Algorithm to try to solve the Travelling salesman problem .

TSP is an NP-Hard problem that asks the following question:

Given a set of cities (vertices) and the distances between each pair of cities (weighted edges), what is the shortest possible (weighted) cycle that contains all the cities?
