# genetic algorithm
A genetic algorithm is a search heuristic that is inspired by Charles Darwinâ€™s theory of natural evolution. This algorithm reflects the process of natural selection where the fittest individuals are selected for reproduction in order to produce offspring of the next generation.

START
Generate the initial population
Compute fitness
REPEAT
    Selection
    Crossover
    Mutation
    Compute fitness
UNTIL population has converged
STOP
