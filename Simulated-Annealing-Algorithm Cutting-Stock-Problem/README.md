# solve Cutting Stock Problem by simulated annealing algorithm

Cutting Stock Problem is the problem of cutting standard-sized pieces of stock material, such as paper rolls or sheet metal, into pieces of specified (requested) sizes whilst minimizing material wasted. It is an optimization problem in mathematics that arises from applications in industry. In terms of computational complexity, the problem is an NP-hard problem.
